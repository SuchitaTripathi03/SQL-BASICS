        "Constraints in a database serve as essential rules that enforce the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the data stored within tables. They act as safeguards, ensuring that only valid and meaningful information enters the system. For instance, a **NOT NULL** constraint prevents critical fields like employee names from being left blank, while a **CHECK** constraint can enforce logical conditions—such as ensuring an employee’s age is at least 18. A **UNIQUE** constraint guarantees that no two employees share the same email address, preserving identity and avoiding duplication. The **PRIMARY KEY** constraint uniquely identifies each record, making retrieval and referencing efficient and error-free. Additionally, **DEFAULT** values can automatically populate fields like salary when no input is provided, maintaining consistency across entries. Together, these constraints uphold data integrity by reducing human error, supporting relational logic between tables, and streamlining the validation process at the database level—making the system more robust and trustworthy.\n"

This is crucial when the column holds essential information—like a person's name, ID, or date of birth—where the absence of data would compromise the integrity or usefulness of the record. For example, if an employee’s name were allowed to be NULL, it would be difficult to identify or reference that individual meaningfully.\n",

Therefore, every column that is part of a primary key must be both **NOT NULL** and **unique**, ensuring that each row is reliably and distinctly identifiable.\n"
